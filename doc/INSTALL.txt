1. Unpack the extension and place it in your extension directory (as with all
   extensions).

2. Set the site access you want the scheduler to run under, in
   ezscriptmonitor.ini.append.php

3. Set the path to your PHP CLI executable, in ezscriptmonitor.ini.append.php

4. Insert the table into your database: sql/mysql/ezscriptmonitor.sql

5. Setup the cronjob part "runscheduledscripts" to run often, every minute is
   recommended.

6. Enable the extension (as with all extensions).

7. Apply the patches for those parts of the system you want script monitoring
   for, see the patches directory. (Currently there is only one patch here,
   for subtree removal.)
